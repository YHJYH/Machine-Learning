logistic regression: prediction y is 1 => y => 0<br>
<br>
<b>logistic regression model</b>
<b>sigmoid function/logistic function</b><br>
hypothesis representation: h_theta(x) = g(z), where z theta^T x<br>
g(z) = 1/(1+e^-z)<br>
and h_theta(x) = estimated probability of y=1 on input x = P(y=1|x;theta)<br>

linear and nonlinear DB<br>
<br>
cost function<br>
logistic regression cost function (general form)<br>
not use linear regression cost function because it is a non-convex function: too many local minima.<br>
