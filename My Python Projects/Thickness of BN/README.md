# Introduction 
This is the second assignment of three assignments of the course PHYS20161 Introduction to Programming for Physicists.<br>

BN is  a  crystalline  compound  that  is  composed  of  2D  layers  of  boron  and  nitrogen  in  a hexagonal lattice.  <br>
It is often used as an electrical insulator or as a substrate for graphene.<br>
In this project you will measure the thickness of a sample of BN by analysing the fraction of electrons that tunnel through.  <br>
You will do this using an approach that is very similar to what is implemented at research level.<br>
## Background Theory
Quantum  tunnelling  allows  a  particle  to  pass  through  a  potential  at  energies  that  classicallywould be forbidden. The fraction of projectiles that tunnel through the barrier are given by thetransmission coefficient,_T_:
